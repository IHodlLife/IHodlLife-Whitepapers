🧬 IHodlLife Rewards Chain (IHRC)

The World’s First Loyalty-Driven Layer 1 Blockchain  
Powered by Proof of Loyalty™ • Built for Builders, Creators, and Culture

Welcome to the official documentation hub for IHodlLife Labs™ - creators of the IHRC, a sovereign Layer 1 blockchain designed to evolve how humans earn, connect, and remember.

🔎 Why It Matters

IHRC is not just a blockchain - it’s a resonant economy built around identity, frequency, and remembrance.  
We are designing infrastructure where creators, merchants, and communities don’t just earn - they evolve.
